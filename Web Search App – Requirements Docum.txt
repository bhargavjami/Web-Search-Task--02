Web Search App – Requirements Document & Project Plan
=====================================================

1. Project Overview
-------------------
We are developing a smartphone and browser-based web search application 
that searches a specific website and returns the most relevant results. 
The app will feature advanced filtering, keyword highlighting, and 
AI-driven search suggestions.

2. Functional Requirements
--------------------------
• Website-Specific Search
   - User can input a search query.
   - App searches only within the specified website’s content.
   - Display results ranked by relevance.

• Result Display
   - Highlight keywords in results.
   - Show snippet/preview of matching content.
   - Provide clickable links to the source page.

• Filtering & Sorting
   - Filter by date, category, or content type.
   - Sort by relevance or newest first.

• AI-Driven Suggestions
   - Suggest related search queries.
   - Offer autocomplete as user types.

• Multi-Platform Support
   - Native mobile apps for iOS (latest) and Android (latest).
   - Responsive web app for desktop & mobile browsers.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
------------------------------
• Performance: Search results should load within 2 seconds 
  on standard broadband.
• Usability: Clean, intuitive, and minimal UI. 
  Consistent design across devices.
• Compatibility: 
  - Mobile: iOS 17+ and Android 14+.
  - Web: Latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.
• Security: HTTPS encryption. Secure API communication.
• Scalability: Support up to 100,000 searches per day 
  without performance loss.

4. BDD Example Scenarios
------------------------
Feature: Website-specific search
  Scenario: User searches for a keyword
    Given the user is on the search page
    When the user enters "arc reactor" and presses Search
    Then the app should display a list of pages from the specified website 
    containing "arc reactor"
    And highlight the keyword "arc reactor" in the results

Feature: AI-driven suggestions
  Scenario: User begins typing a search term
    Given the user is on the search page
    When the user types "Iron M"
    Then the app should display suggestions such as 
    "Iron Man", "Iron Man suit", "Iron Man 2"
